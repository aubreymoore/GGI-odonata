# GGI-odonata

This repo documents my first attempt to annotate an article using GoldenGate Imagine (GGI) following training material available from the [Plazi Community repo](https://github.com/plazi/community).

## Annotation progress

Currently stuck. I cannot figure out how to annotate the final paragraph in the *Ishnura delicata* treatment as **Distribution**.
The IMF file can be downloaded fron this repo.

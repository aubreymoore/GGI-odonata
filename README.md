# GGI-odonata

This repo documents my first attempt to annotate an article using GoldenGate Imagine (GGI) following training material available from the [Plazi Community repo](https://github.com/plazi/community). I am using a copy of GGI installed on a Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) machine following [steps listed here](https://github.com/aubreymoore/GGI-Linux).

## Data acquisition

I am attempting to annotate a simple artile entitled *Odonta: Dragonflies of Guam* which is contained in *Bernice P. Bishop Museum Bulletin 172: Insects of Guam 1* which is available online. From previous experience, I know that the online PDFs contain some OCR problems, so I decided to have GGI redo the OCR:

## Annotation progress

Currently stuck. I cannot figure out how to annotate the final paragraph in the *Ishnura delicata* treatment as **Distribution**.
